	Hi, Justin!
<br>
This page will be the 'center of communications' between us, I'll make sure all links are on this page.
<br>
An easier way to access this page is through this <a href='https://is.gd/ccFamJustin'>link</a> (The link is easier to remember: just type in the address "is.gd/ccFamJustin")
<br>
By the way, I'm temporarily using ccFam as short for <b><u></u>C</b></u>hild-<b><u>c</u></b>are <b><u>Fa</u></b>cility <b><u>M<u></b>anagement System.  Here's the logo I'm using (we can replace it with a better one later perhaps):<br>

<br>
Since we're having hassles with email, I've set up a Discussion Board (this site already offers this feature for Software Developers).  Even better, it doesn't require a login.  Just click on the link to access the <a href='https://github.com/brijUser2/brijuser2.github.io/discussions'>ccFam Disccusion Board</a>.<br>
Please also add a test message whenever you can.<br>
All messages will be auto-saved; if later we get unauthorized people we can move the discussion elsewhere.
<br>
I'm really glad you happened to drop in @ Bloomingdale; otherwise I'd have been waiting for your email reply and thinking you're busy with work :-)
<br>
Again, I'm working on the Proposal as we speak and will have a good initial document to show you by this weekend, including ScreenShots with demo data etc.
<br>
Thanks,
-Mike
