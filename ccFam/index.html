	Hi, Justin!
<br>
This page will be the 'center of communications' between us, I'll make sure all links are on this page.
<br>
An easier way to access this page is through this <a href='https://is.gd/ccFamJustin'>link</a> (The link is easier to remember: just type in the address "is.gd/ccFamJustin")
<br>
By the way, I'm temporarily using ccFam as short for <b><u></u>C</b></u>hild-<b><u>c</u></b>are <b><u>Fa</u></b>cility <b><u>M</u></b>anagement System.  Here's the logo I'm using (we can replace it with a better one later perhaps):<br>

<br>
I just got the email you sent to me @ 1pm; so we don't need any workarounds for now; we can communicate via email and I'll use this email to post links to work.
<br>
I'm really glad you happened to drop in @ Bloomingdale; otherwise I'd have been waiting for your email reply and thinking you're busy with work :-)
<br>
Again, I'm working on the Proposal as we speak and will have a good initial document to show you by this weekend, including ScreenShots with demo data etc.
<br>
Thanks,
-Mike
